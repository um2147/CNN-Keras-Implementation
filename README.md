# Feed forward NN & CNN-Keras-Implementation
Explored the usage of GridSearch on a multi-layer perceptron on the iris dataset.

Also explored the effects of drop-out, batch normalization and residual connections on a multi-layer perceptron neural network on the Fashion MNIST data set. Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting.

Lastly, the notebook also includes a convolutional neural network on the breast histopathology images dataset from kaggle. Undersampling, scaling, resizing and image augmentation was done in this exercise. The effects of residual connections on a deeper model with 20 hidden layers was also explored.
